## Now, what *does* it actually do?

After you run the programm you get asked what the capital of Japan is. You insert your answer and *IF* it's correct you get some applause, if not you get a second chance. After three tries you fail the test.

## What are the features?

If you quickly want to check your knowlege this programm ist *THE* thing for you. Quick and easy fun *AND* you can actually learn something!

## What I learned in the last couple weeks.

I learned to actually write code and not just copy it from some unnamed forums. This knowlege will definitely be helpful sometime in the future. I understood a code I saw in a video some time ago and I didn't even know what language exactly it was in. These moments where I can actually use something I learned in school are quiet rare but it's always a cool thing.
